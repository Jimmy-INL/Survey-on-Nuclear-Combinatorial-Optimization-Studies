@article{Hays:2011,
	Abstract = {The process of finding optimized fuel reload patterns for boiling water reactors is complicated by a number of factors including the large number of fuel assemblies involved, the three-dimensional neutronic and thermal-hydraulic variations, and the interplay of coolant flow rate with control rod programming. The FORMOSA-B code was developed to provide an automated method for finding fuel loading patterns, control rod programs and coolant flow rate schedules to minimize certain quantitative metrics of core performance while satisfying given operational constraints. One drawback of this code has been the long runtimes required for a complete cycle optimization on a desktop workstation (oftentimes several days or more). To address this shortcoming, a parallel simulated annealing algorithm has been added to the FORMOSA-B code, so that the runtimes may be greatly reduced by using a multiprocessor computer cluster. Tests of the algorithm on a sample problem indicate that it is capable of parallel efficiencies exceeding 80% when using four processors.},

	Abstract = {An in-core fuel reload design tool using the improved pivot particle swarm method was developed for the loading pattern optimization problems in a typical PWR, such as Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The discrete, multi-objective improved pivot particle swarm optimization, was integrated with the in-core physics calculation code `donjon' based on finite element method, and assemblies' group constant calculation code `dragon', composing the optimization code for fuel arrangement. The codes of both `donjon' and `dragon' were programmed by Institute of Nuclear Eng. of Polytechnique Montr{\'e}al, Canada. This optimization code was aiming to maximize the core effective multiplication factor (Keff), while keeping the local power peaking factor (Ppf) lower than a predetermined value to maintain fuel integrity. At last, the code was applied to the first cycle loading of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The result showed that, compared with the reference loading pattern design, the core effective multiplication factor increased by 9.6%, while the power peaking factor decreased by 0.6%, meeting the safety requirement.},
